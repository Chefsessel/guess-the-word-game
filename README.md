# guess-the-word-game
## A simple Hangman variation in HTML5 / JavaScript

The result of a lazy saturday afternoon. Try to win the game by guessing the word within 10 tries. Otherwise you lose the game.

For the ease of doing, words are stored as simple strings in an array, so it's easy to spot them client-side. I may add in some server-side magic to make them disappear from the source, if I find the time. Likewise, the game could use some nice css3 animations e.g. ran out of time when I was creating a notification when the user chooses a letter for the second time. If anyone's up for the task, any help appreciated! Don't forget to let me know, always curious to see the ideas of others. :-)
