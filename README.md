# guess-the-word-game
## A simple Hangman variation in HTML5 / JavaScript

Try to win the game by guessing the word within 10 tries. Otherwise you lose the game. (The result of a lazy saturday afternoon) 

For the ease of doing, words are stored as simple strings in an array, so it's easy to spot them client-side. I may add in some server-side magic to make them disappear from the source, if I find the time.

Likewise, the game could use some nice css3 animations e.g. ran out of time when I was creating a notification when the user chooses a letter for the second time.

If anyone's up for the task, any help appreciated! Don't forget to let me know, always curious to see the ideas of others. :-)
